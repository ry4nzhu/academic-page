My name is Ruiyang Zhu. I am a first-year Ph.D. student in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/) at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), advised by Prof. [Z. Morley Mao](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~zmao/). My research includes broadly computer systems and networks, with a focus on networked system and mobile networks. Before the start of my Ph.D. journey, I received my bachelor degrees in computer engineering at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) and the University of Michigan, where I had a happy time doing mobile network and opearting system research.
