abstract: "With 5G's support for diverse radio bands and different deployment modes, e.g. standalone (SA) vs. non-standalone (NSA), mobility management - especially the handover process - becomes far more complex. Measurement studies have shown that frequent handovers cause wild fluctuations in 5G throughput, and worst, service outages. Through a cross-country (6,200km+) driving trip, we conduct in-depth measurements to study the current 5G mobility management practices adopted by three major US carriers. Using this rich dataset, we carry out a systematic analysis to uncover the handover mechanisms employed by 5G carriers, and compare them along several dimensions such as (4G vs. 5G) radio technologies, radio (low-, mid- & high-)bands, and deployment (SA vs NSA) modes. We further quantify the impact of mobility on application performance, power consumption, and signaling overheads. We identify key challenges facing todayâ€™s NSA 5G deployments which result in unnecessary handovers and reduced coverage. Finally, we design a holistic handover prediction system Prognos and demonstrate its ability to improve QoE for two 5G applications 16K panoramic VoD and real-time volumetric video streaming. We have released the datasets and tools of our study at https://github.com/SIGCOMM22-5GMobility/artifact."
